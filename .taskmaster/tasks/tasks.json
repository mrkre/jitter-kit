        "details": "This task involves setting up the foundational UI structure for the application:\n\n1. Create the main application container with appropriate CSS grid or flexbox layout\n2. Implement the header component with:\n   - Application logo/name\n   - Navigation menu (if specified in PRD)\n   - User account/profile section (if applicable)\n3. Design the unified control panel layout with:\n   - Consistent spacing and alignment\n   - Placeholder sections for future controls\n   - Responsive design considerations for different screen sizes\n4. Set up basic routing structure (if using a SPA framework)\n5. Implement basic theme variables for colors, typography, and spacing\n6. Ensure accessibility standards are met (proper heading hierarchy, ARIA attributes)\n7. Create reusable layout components that can be extended in future tasks\n\nUse semantic HTML elements and follow the design specifications in the PRD. Ensure the layout is responsive and works across all required browsers and devices.",
        "testStrategy": "1. Visual inspection against design mockups in the PRD\n2. Verify responsive behavior by testing at multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)\n3. Check browser compatibility in all required browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\n4. Validate HTML structure using browser developer tools\n5. Run accessibility checks using tools like Lighthouse or axe\n6. Verify that the layout accommodates dynamic content without breaking\n7. Test keyboard navigation through the interface\n8. Ensure the application shell renders correctly with no console errors\n9. Verify that the layout structure can be easily extended for future components\n10. Document any deviations from the PRD with justification",
