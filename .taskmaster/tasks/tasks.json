            "details": "This task involves implementing several canvas performance optimization techniques:\n\n1. Off-screen rendering:\n   - Create a secondary, off-screen canvas for rendering complex elements\n   - Implement a buffer system where patterns are rendered to an off-screen canvas first\n   - Only copy the completed render to the visible canvas when ready\n   - Example implementation:\n   ```typescript\n   // Create off-screen buffer\n   const offscreenCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n   offscreenCanvas.width = mainCanvas.width;\n   offscreenCanvas.height = mainCanvas.height;\n   const offscreenCtx = offscreenCanvas.getContext('2d');\n   \n   // Render to off-screen buffer\n   function renderToBuffer() {\n     // Perform complex rendering operations on offscreenCtx\n     // ...\n     \n     // Copy to main visible canvas only when complete\n     mainCtx.drawImage(offscreenCanvas, 0, 0);\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Layer caching:\n   - Identify static or slowly changing elements in the jitter patterns\n   - Implement a caching system to store rendered layers that don't need frequent updates\n   - Only re-render layers when their parameters change\n   - Use a multi-layer approach where appropriate:\n     - Background layer (rarely changes)\n     - Mid-ground layer (changes occasionally)\n     - Foreground layer (changes frequently)\n\n3. Optimize the animation loop:\n   - Implement frame skipping for high-complexity patterns\n   - Add dynamic quality adjustment based on FPS monitoring\n   - Consider implementing a request-cancel pattern for the animation frame:\n   ```typescript\n   let animationFrameId: number;\n   \n   function startAnimation() {\n     cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameId); // Cancel any existing request\n     animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n   }\n   \n   function stopAnimation() {\n     cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameId);\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Implement canvas size optimization:\n   - Scale canvas based on device pixel ratio for crisp rendering\n   - Consider downscaling during rapid animations, then restoring quality when static\n   - Example implementation:\n   ```typescript\n   function optimizeCanvasForDevice() {\n     const dpr = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;\n     const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();\n     \n     canvas.width = rect.width * dpr;\n     canvas.height = rect.height * dpr;\n     canvas.style.width = `${rect.width}px`;\n     canvas.style.height = `${rect.height}px`;\n     \n     ctx.scale(dpr, dpr);\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects:\n   - Create a pool of reusable objects for pattern elements\n   - Recycle objects instead of creating new ones to reduce garbage collection\n   - Example implementation:\n   ```typescript\n   class ParticlePool {\n     private pool: Particle[] = [];\n     private activeParticles: Particle[] = [];\n     \n     constructor(size: number) {\n       // Pre-allocate particles\n       for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n         this.pool.push(new Particle());\n       }\n     }\n     \n     getParticle(): Particle {\n       let particle = this.pool.pop();\n       if (!particle) {\n         particle = new Particle();\n       }\n       this.activeParticles.push(particle);\n       return particle;\n     }\n     \n     recycleParticle(particle: Particle) {\n       const index = this.activeParticles.indexOf(particle);\n       if (index > -1) {\n         this.activeParticles.splice(index, 1);\n         particle.reset();\n         this.pool.push(particle);\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. Integration with existing components:\n   - Modify the P5Sketch component to incorporate these optimization techniques\n   - Update the animation loop in Task #5 to leverage the new optimizations\n   - Ensure the optimizations work with the pattern extensibility from Task #6",

Implement visual feedback during debounce period:\n   - Add subtle visual indicators to show that changes are pending\n   - Consider using a small \"updating\" indicator that appears during the debounce period\n\n5. Make the debounce delay configurable:\n   - Add a configuration option for debounce delay (default: 150ms)\n   - Consider different delays for different parameter types (e.g., shorter for critical parameters)\n\n6. Special handling for certain parameters:\n   - Identify any parameters that should update immediately without debouncing\n   - Create a mechanism to bypass debouncing for these special cases\n\n7. Performance monitoring:\n   - Add performance tracking to measure the impact of debouncing\n   - Log render frequency before and after implementation",
