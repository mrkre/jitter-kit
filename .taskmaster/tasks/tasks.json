Design the unified control panel layout with:\n   - Consistent spacing and alignment\n   - Placeholder sections for future controls\n   - Responsive design considerations for different screen sizes\n4. Set up basic routing structure (if using a SPA framework)\n5. Implement basic theme variables for colors, typography, and spacing\n6. Ensure accessibility standards are met (proper heading hierarchy, ARIA attributes)\n7. Create reusable layout components that can be extended in future tasks\n\nUse semantic HTML elements and follow the design specifications in the PRD. Ensure the layout is responsive and works across all required browsers and devices.",
